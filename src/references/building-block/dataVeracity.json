      "@value": "The data veracity component makes the trust and accountability relationship in dataspace scenarios symmetric: while consent agreements constrain what a data consumer is allowed to do with received data, veracity agreements capture the agreed-on key quality properties of the data made available by data producers. To that end, the building block enables parties to strike and manage data veracity agreements for a wide range of data properties (basic data properties, data set completeness and exclusion properties, generic statistical properties, model properties and domain-specific properties), using a common, semantically supported descriptive approach and formulated as Verifiable Credentials. The building block also supports the verification of data veracity through a range of verification models. Depending on the veracity acceptance model agreed on by the parties and the type of property and data, these include third-party attestation; consumer-side automated evaluation of data properties and producer-side property proving (incl. zero-knowledge approaches). In addition to support in the veracity agreements management functionality, the building block provides technical support for executing the verification models. Last but not least, the veracity building block will aim to integrate with the data value chain tracker bulding block, as veracity can be a key concern in certain models of data value."
