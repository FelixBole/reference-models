The LRC specifies and develops APIs for converting educational traces from one standard to another to facilitate the integration of learning trace datasets expressed in different standards. By transforming diverse records into the xAPI DASES Profile, the LRC will facilitate data interoperability and enable efficient data exchange within the Dataspace."
