It will help jobs and skills data interoperability by transforming the data-format from multiple sources to a same standard format as well as help to find matchings between source's skills and ESCO and provide matching suggestions improvements with the usage. Edge Translator converts known ontologies on fly to a shared pivotal ontology either on-device or at server side. On-device translators are meant to decrease network and computing consumption while server-side conversions could have better performance. This building block enables external translation services to be connected / included into the process."
