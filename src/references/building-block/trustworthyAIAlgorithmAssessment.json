It brings together organizations seeking to securely share learning data generated by the use of educational resources that they publish online, and designers of AI algorithms who wish to demonstrate in an open and transparent approach, the qualities and performances of these algorithms. 2. AffectLog 360 is an AI risk assessment tool that advances AI fairness, explainability and privacy standards by tailoring them to specific contextual needs."
